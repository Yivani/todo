# Todo List Website By Yivani

**Project Description:**

The ToDo List website is a simple application that allows users to manage their tasks. The page is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean user interface. Here's a brief description and guide:

**Functionality:**
1. **Add Tasks:** Users can enter new tasks into the input field and click the "Add" button to add them to the list.
2. **Remove Tasks:** Each task in the list comes with a "Remove" button, allowing users to remove tasks when they are completed.

**Data Storage:**
The ToDo List does not permanently store tasks. There is no collection or storage of user data on a server. The information is retained only during the browser session. If the page is refreshed or the browser is closed, the data is lost.

**Usage:**
1. **Add Task:** Enter the text of your task into the input field and click the "Add" button.
2. **Remove Task:** Click the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it.
3. **Appearance:** The page is intuitively designed to enhance user-friendliness.

It's essential to note that this is a simple front-end application and does not provide authentication or server-side storage. Therefore, it is more suitable for personal use or as a learning project.
